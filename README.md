# lcode

This cli tool lists all your repositories, uppon selection it starts Visual Studio Code.

## Usage

```shell
npx lcode
> select your repo and enter
```

## Background

Actually I just wanted to cd into the selected directory however it does, but then exits the program and you are back on the original working directory. Hence I started vscode instead.
